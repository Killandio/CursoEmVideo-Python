## 🌍 Important Notes for International Users

While the comments in the code are written in **English** to make the repository accessible to a broader audience, the actual Python code is in **Portuguese**. This decision reflects the course's context, which is aimed at Portuguese-speaking students. If you're an English speaker, the comments provide sufficient context to understand the solutions, even if the code itself is in Portuguese.

## 🇧🇷 Nota para Brasileiros

Os comentários dos códigos estão em **inglês** para alcançar uma audiência maior, mas o código permanece em **português**, como no curso. Isso mantém a lógica e os exemplos alinhados ao aprendizado proposto pelo professor Gustavo Guanabara.
